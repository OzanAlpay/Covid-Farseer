## What is it?
[Live Demo](https://ozanalpay.github.io/)

This tool built for making easy to visualize coronavirus based discussions(. Just enter your predictions for a country, and share chart with your friends. Since I did it in order to not only review my vue.js skills but also give it a try to [inkline](https://inkline.io/) framework, probably there won't be any additional feature/development. But if you add a feature into it, pull requests are more than welcome.
